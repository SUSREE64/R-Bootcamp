# Variables should sart with a small letter
bank.balance <- 1000 # Notice the . in the variable name, <- assignment operator
bank.withdraw <- 20
bank.deposit <- 200
bank.balance <- bank.balance+bank.deposit-bank.withdraw
print(bank.balance)
# Variables also can be assigned with values using "="
# But this not the convension
